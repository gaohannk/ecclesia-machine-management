description:
  "jsoncpp is an implementation of a JSON (http://json.org) reader and "
  "writer in C++. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight "
  "data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is "
  "easy for machines to parse and generate. [From website] "
  " "
  "While google3/net/proto/json/ already contains some code for parsing "
  "JSON, it is very JSON <-> PB-centric and requires the user to extend the "
  "parser class to implement his own storage. jsoncpp provides an easy an "
  "intuitive way to manipulate JSON structures. "
