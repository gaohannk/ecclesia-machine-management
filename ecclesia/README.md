# Ecclesia

This package contains code for the Ecclesia (go/ecclesia) project which is
targetted for eventual publication outside of Google. It is currently 100%
Google code which has not yet been shared.

Since this is intended for eventual release it should only depend on other
projects and packages which are publicly available under a permissive (e.g.
unencumbered, notice) licence.

Additional code which is intended for internal use only is located in
google3/platforms/ecclesia. That code can (and does) depend upon this package,
but the reverse of that is not allowed.
