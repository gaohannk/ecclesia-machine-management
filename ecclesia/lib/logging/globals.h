// Definitions of the global objects used by the logging system, along with
// functions for getting and setting them. This header is normally only needed
// if you want to install your own logging implementation.
//
// There are three major things provided by this library:
//
// 1. A default logging implementation, set up when the logging system is first
//    constructed. This does minimal logging to stderr and is normally intended
//    to be replaced with something more fully featured.
//
// 2. Some objects that can be used to implement the actual user logging
//    functions. The LogMessageStream class is used as a temporary object in
//    log invocations to capture the logging text, and the LoggingStreamFactory
//    is used to wrap the LoggingInterface and construct LogMessageStream
//    instances. These object should never really be used directly by either
//    users _or_ backend implementers.
//
// 3. (Get|Set)GlobalLogger functions for installing a global logger, or getting
//    access to it to do logging.
//
// It is important to note that installing a new logger is not threadsafe. This
// generally means that you should not use SetGlobalLogger while a program is
// running multiple threads. Calling SetGlobalLogger will destroy the logging
// object pointed to by every outstanding LogMessageStream and so it is only
// safe to call if nothing is using the logging yet.
//
// It is okay to use the logging system before SetGlobalLogger is called (e.g.
// to log errors that occur while trying to set up the logger) so log as all
// logging is finished before the call is made.
